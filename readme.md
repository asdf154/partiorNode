To Run:

Improvements:
- use property or table driven tests
- cache http call results
- logging with log level


Notes:
- My team generally practices little to no comments. The idea is that each function should be well named, non side effecting unless necessary, and small enough to understand. The overall behaviour should then be created by composing and combining functions together
- Just having fun with some of the variables and naming. "Real" work won't have such whimsical names :)
